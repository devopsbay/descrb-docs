Afterward, a summary will be displayed, allowing you to edit each field in the matrix.\
You can delete, modify, or add input search information to ensure that specific keywords or additional details are included in the description. Please note that only the product image is required to generate a complete description.

You can do this by clicking the green tick in the validation column or use the checkboxes on the right side to bulk validate. Choose one of the available actions: “Validate” or “Invalidate.”
