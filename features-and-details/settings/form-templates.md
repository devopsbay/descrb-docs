# Form templates

During the describing process, you can mark the toggle to save the current settings as a template. It is also possible to choose a previously created template, update it, and rename it.

All saved templates can be managed from the **Settings → Form templates** section. Templates are displayed with basic information such as template name, description language, language style, length, and keywords. Each template has inline actions to edit or delete it.

Above the existing templates list, there is an “**add template”** button. Clicking this button opens the template creation tool, where you can set all the key parameters available in the “**Describe”** section.
