# Billing {Plans}

This section displays the user's current plan, counts and displays the remaining descriptions in the plan, and other available purchases.

You can choose between:

* **Credits**: Purchase a specific number of descriptions with no expiration date.
* **Yearly Subscription**: Subscribe to a yearly plan with an annually renewable description amount.
* **Custom Solutions**: Contact the Descrb team to negotiate a custom solution to meet your needs.

You can also mix the plans by subscribing to a yearly plan and buying additional credits as needed.
