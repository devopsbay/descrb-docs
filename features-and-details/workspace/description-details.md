# Description details

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-08-09 172531.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The description detailed screen consists of the main description generated by the AI, build with the parameters selected in the “describe” screen. On the right side, there is a summary of the basic information filled out by the user in the initial “describe” screen, along with an action menu specific to this description.

&#x20;

All AI-generated information can be copied using the copy icon, manually edited by the user using the pen icon, and regenerated if needed. Please note that each click on the regeneration icon costs one credit per description. Only the Product name can be regenerated for free using a predefined list of product names.

&#x20;

At the bottom of the page, there are key search data that the description was based on. These are linked to their source URLs, allowing users to open the source in a new browser tab with a click.

If the brand name or product name is provided by the user on the Describe screen, it will override the AI search data and be displayed as desired by the user.

* **Regenerate** - Enables regenerating the entire description with adjustments to the originally selected parameters and provided names/IDs. Please note that regeneration of description will use one description from your account.
* **Add Photo/Replace Photo -** Allows adding a photo to a description generated based on the Name or Product ID, or replacing a photo with one of the variants generated in the “Your Photos” section. The photo becomes a base photo for the description.
* **Translate** - Translates the desired description or its variant into another language from the available dropdown menu. Multiple translations can be created simultaneously. Each translation is a new variant and counts as a new description, costing a credit for each translation/variant.

* **Green Tick:** Validates the description and marks the base description or variant with an "Approved" status.
* **Red Cross:** Marks the description as incorrect and assigns the base description or variant a "Rejected" status. When a description is rejected, the application prompts the user to regenerate it.
