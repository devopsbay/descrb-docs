# Your photos

On your first visit to the Photos screen, you'll be prompted to add photos using various methods: drag and drop from an open folder, upload from your device, add links using image URLs, or add links by selecting image files stored in Google Drive by using the "Share" and "Copy link" options and pasting those links via “add link” button.

After uploading first photos they will be added to “Files” and displayed on default in tiles as photo miniatures with summary upload description. You can switch from the tile view to the list view by clicking the list icon located above the photos on the right side.
