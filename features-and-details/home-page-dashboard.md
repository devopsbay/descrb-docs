# Home page/ Dashboard

**Shortcuts**&#x20;

Home page consists of tiles that are shortcuts redirecting the user to different subpages. By default there are four tiles: “describe”, “csv upload”, “go to workspace” and “add photos”.

The user can insert additional shortcuts to his home page by utilizing the “+” button.
